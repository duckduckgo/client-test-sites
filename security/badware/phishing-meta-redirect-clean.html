    <h1>Phishing Redirect via Meta Refresh</h1>

    <p>This is an example page that loads a phishing page via a meta refresh to test how the browser responds. If you arrive here by mistake; there's
        nothing to worry about, we just use this page to test if our client blocking is working.</p>
