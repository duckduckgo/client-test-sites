<h1>Phishing Page JS Redirects (Direct)</h1>

<p>This is a helper page that is used to redirect to a page that should be classified as phishing. This page itself should not be classified as phishing in our datasets, but since it redirects to a page that is, the error page should still be shown. If you arrive here by mistake; there's nothing to worry about, we just use this page to test if our client blocking is
working.</p>
