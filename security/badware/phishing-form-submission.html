    <h1>Phishing Page Form Submission</h1>

    <p>This is an example page that, although it is not in our phishing dataset, it submits a form to an endpoint that is in our phishing dataset. If you arrive here by mistake; there's nothing to worry about, we just use this page to test if our
        client blocking is working.</p>

        <input type="hidden" name="phishing" value="true">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
