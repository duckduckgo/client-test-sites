  This test uses a download URL that performs a HTTP redirect for downloading a file to trick the
  browser into displaying the download URL as the current origin while rewriting the document content
  resulting in a spoofed address bar.
  The expected result is that the redirect should be followed and the file should be downloaded 
  in the about:blank context instead of in the context of the download URL where the document might
  be spoofed by the previous page.
