    <p>This test will navigate to page on a https upgradable domain that immediately redirects to its http version. This will cause a http↔http loop (client trying to upgrade, page downgrading). Clients should detect this scenario and allow page to load.</p>
    <p>If the loop protection works the reported url will be "http:" and not "https:".</p>
